### Database Requirements

1. _Sign up for [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Start a new project and generate an API key._


2. _Run `$ git clone` [https://github.com/mostriki/hygge-box](https://github.com/mostriki/hygge-box) in your Desktop to download the project directory locally._

3. _Run `$ cd hygge-box/` to change from your Desktop to the HyggeBox directory._

4. _Run `$ touch src/app/api-keys.ts` to create a new file called `api-keys.ts`._

5. _Add your Firebase API key to `api-keys.ts`. It should look like this:_

` export const masterFirebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  authDomain: "XXXX.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://XXXXXXXX.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "XXXX",
  storageBucket: "XXXX.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "XXXXXXXXXXX"
};
firebase.initializeApp(config);`

6. _Run `$ npm install` to install the node dependencies._

7. _Run `$ ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files._
